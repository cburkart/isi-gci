# isi-gci
Collaborative space for IS-GC project

These are results from two rounds of data collection, one in the United States and the other in Japan. The process of translating  the English (original) survey instrument into Japanese was published [here](https://iccglobal.org/2020/09/30/applicability-of-gci-and-isi-in-japanese-educational-environment/). The US data file has undergone cleaning and processing, while the Japan data is signficantly more "raw."

## Data description

The survey instrument questions can be put in three categories:
1. Intercultural Sensitivity Index (ISI) questions
2. Global Competence Index (GCI) questions
3. Demographic and other indiviual descriptors (age, ethnicity, etc.)

## Data dictionary

A link to example survey instruments will be added here. A combination of paper and online surveys was used.

ISx (where 1 < x <= 25) - questions realated to ISI measurement

GCx (where 1 < x <= 24) - questions realated to GCI measurement

Demographics to be fleshed out later, particularly those common to both country surveys.
